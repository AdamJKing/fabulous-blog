This is a blog for sharing topics that I've been working on or thinking about recently. My aim is to write about the kind of topics that bridge the beginner to intermediate gap that is sometimes missing when it comes to technical blogs out there.

Adam is functional software engineer working primarily on the JVM with languages like Scala, as well as the TypeLevel stack in recent years, in order to build all kinds of services.
